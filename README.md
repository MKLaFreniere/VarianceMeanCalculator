# VarianceMeanCalculator
This was an interesting project I did when I was in a Machine Language course

It involves finding the variance and mean of an array of integers. Normally this
would be very easy, except this time I had to do it in assembly! I've heard many people 
hate this langauge, as it can be tedious to code things.
For me, it made me really appreciate the languages we have today that can make things
so easy. Part of me really wants to go back to this kind of language one day, just to 
get the experience of working so closely with the computer. Maybe it could be a project
related to making a game for an old computer.
